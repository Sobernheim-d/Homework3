# Oceans Guess Game

Oceans gues game is a word guess game to guess the 7 oceans of the world.  There is some controversy if there are 5 or 7 oceans, but for the purposes of this code I went with the following:

North Atlantic
South Atlantic
North Pacific
South Pacific
Indian Ocean
Southern Ocean
Artic Ocean
